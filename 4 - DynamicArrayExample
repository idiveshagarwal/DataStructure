These are preprocessor directives that include the necessary header files for input and output operations and dynamic memory allocation.

struct myArray
{
    int total_size;
    int used_size;
    int *ptr;
};

This defines a structure called `myArray`, which represents a dynamic array. It contains three members: `total_size` to store the total size of the array, `used_size` to store the number of elements used in the array, and `ptr` which is a pointer to the dynamically allocated array.

void createArray(struct myArray * a, int tSize, int uSize){

This is a function definition for `createArray`. It takes a pointer to a `myArray` structure (`a`), an integer `tSize` representing the total size of the array, and an integer `uSize` representing the number of elements initially used in the array.

    a->total_size = tSize;
    a->used_size = uSize;
    a->ptr = (int *)malloc(tSize * sizeof(int));

Inside `createArray`, this code initializes the `total_size` and `used_size` members of the `myArray` structure and dynamically allocates memory for the array pointed to by `ptr`.

void show(struct myArray *a){

This is a function definition for `show`. It takes a pointer to a `myArray` structure (`a`) as a parameter.

    for (int i = 0; i < a->used_size; i++)
    {
        printf("%d\n", (a->ptr)[i]);
    }
}

Inside `show`, this code prints the elements of the dynamic array pointed to by `ptr`.

void setVal(struct myArray *a){

This is a function definition for `setVal`. It takes a pointer to a `myArray` structure (`a`) as a parameter.

    int n;
    for (int i = 0; i < a->used_size; i++)
    {
        printf("Enter element %d", i);
        scanf("%d", &n);
        (a->ptr)[i] = n;
    }
}

Inside `setVal`, this code prompts the user to input values for each element in the dynamic array and stores those values in the array.

int main(){
    struct myArray marks;
    createArray(&marks, 10, 2);
    printf("We are running setVal now\n");
    setVal(&marks);

    printf("We are running show now\n");
    show(&marks);

    return 0;
}

This is the `main` function where the program starts execution. It declares a `myArray` structure called `marks`, calls `createArray` to initialize it, then calls `setVal` to input values for the elements and `show` to display the elements. Finally, it returns 0 to indicate successful program execution.
